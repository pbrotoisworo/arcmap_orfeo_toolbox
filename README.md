# ArcMap Orfeo Toolbox
The ArcMap Orfeo Toolbox is an ArcMap 10.x Toolbox designed to integrate the [Orfeo Toolbox](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/) command line tools into the the ArcMap environment. The GUI of the toolbox is similar to the Orfeo Toolbox plugin that is available on QGIS 2.x and follows the same default parameters.
